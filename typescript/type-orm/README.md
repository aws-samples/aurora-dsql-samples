# TypeORM with Aurora DSQL

## Overview

This code example demonstrates how to use `TypeORM` with Amazon Aurora DSQL. The example shows you how to connect to an Aurora DSQL cluster and perform basic database operations.

Aurora DSQL is a distributed SQL database service that provides high availability and scalability for your PostgreSQL-compatible applications. `TypeORM` is a popular ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript that allows you to interact with PostgreSQL databases using object-relational mapping patterns.

## About the code example

The example demonstrates a flexible connection approach that works for both admin and non-admin users:

- When connecting as an **admin user**, the example uses the `public` schema and generates an admin authentication
  token.
- When connecting as a **non-admin user**, the example uses a custom `myschema` schema and generates a standard
  authentication token.

The code automatically detects the user type and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## ⚠️ Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
- This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see
  [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the example

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html)
  guide.
- [Node 18.0.0](https://nodejs.org) or later.
- You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating an Aurora DSQL cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  guide.
- If connecting as a non-admin user, ensure the user is linked to an IAM role and is granted access to the `myschema`
  schema. See the
  [Using database roles with IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/using-database-and-iam-roles.html)
  guide.

### Download the Amazon root certificate from the official trust store

Download the Amazon root certificate from the official trust store. This example shows one of the available certs that
can be used by the client. Other certs such as AmazonRootCA2.pem, AmazonRootCA3.pem, etc. can also be used.

```
wget https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem -O root.pem
```

### Set up environment for examples

```
npm install
```

## Run the code

The example demonstrates the following operations:

- Opening a connection to an Aurora DSQL cluster
- Creating a table
- Inserting and querying data

The example is designed to work with both admin and non-admin users:

- When run as an admin user, it uses the `public` schema
- When run as a non-admin user, it uses the `myschema` schema

**Note:** running the example will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

Set environment variables for your cluster details:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="<your user>"

# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your endpoint>"

# e.g. "us-east-1"
export REGION="<your region>"
```

Run the example:

```
# first time running the application
npm run build
npm run migrations-create-table
npm run migrations-run

npm test
```

The example contains comments explaining the code and the operations being performed.
