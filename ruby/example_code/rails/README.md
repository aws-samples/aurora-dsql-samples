## Prerequisites


### Create Cluster

You can access the AWS Management Console for Amazon DSQL at https://console.aws.amazon.com/dsql/home (TBD Update this link before launch)

    * 1. Login to console
    * 2. Create Cluster

        * Accept defaults for example applications
        * Create Cluster


### Driver Dependencies

Rails 7.2 requires Ruby 3.1.0 or newer. You can download Ruby from the [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). 

Verify install
```bash
ruby --version
```

It should output something similar to `ruby 3.3.5`.

Ruby on Rails: 

You can download Ruby On Rails from the [official website](https://gorails.com/setup). 

Verify install
```bash
rails --version
```

Install required postgres jem

``` bash
gem install pg
bundle add pg
bundle install
```

### [TBD] Install DSQL Connection

- Detail required instructions for installing the language specific token generation jem
  - TBD as we currently donâ€™t have the details of where the customer can obtain the jem


### [TBD] Connect to Cluster


## SQL CRUD Examples

> [!Important]
> To execute example code requires that you have AWS Credentials (eg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)


### Update cluster name

Edit the `./config/database.yml` to modify code to set "host: abcdefghijklmnopqrst123456.c0001.us-east-1.gamma.sql.axdb.aws.dev"

#### Console

The Ruby on Rails Console can be used to execute all of the standard CRUD functionality

``` bash
bin/rails console
```

### 1. Create Owner Tables

Following model definition for the Owner object exists in the `db/migrate/<time stamp>_create_owners.rb` file.  The example shows the use of the UUID type, which is required for use for id generation with Aurora DSQL.

``` ruby

class CreateOwners < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.2]
  def change
    create_table :owners, id: :uuid do |t|
      t.string :name, limit: 30
      t.string :city, limit: 80
      t.string :telephone, limit: 20

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

```

Create the database and generate the model from the model files in `db/migrate`.

``` bash
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 2. Create Owner

``` console
owner = Owner.new(name: "John Smith", city: "Seattle", telephone: "123-456-7890")
owner.save
owner
```

### 3. Read Owner

``` console
Owner.find("<owner id>")
```

### 4. Update Owner

``` console
Owner.find("<owner id>").update(telephone: "123-456-7891")
```

### 5. Delete Owner

``` console
Owner.find("<owner id>").destroy
```

## [TBD] Transaction with retries example

Add text to describe that Aurora DSQL requires that in order to handle OC001 error issue the code logic needs to support a transaction retries (Recommend example should be example of the simple CRUD examples and extended to show transaction retries)

TODO Example of transaction retries - This section will be added later
